      	<h3>Why did you make this website ?</h3>
      	<p>Have you seen the amazing stuff people are making with IPython/Jupyter notebooks ? It will blow your mind! So I needed a place where I could find more of these amazing notebooks. For now it's a simple website that displays the latests and most viewed Notebooks, however in the future I would like it to have searching and categorization features.</p>
      	<h3>Who made this website ?</h3>
      	<p>For now it's just me, <a href="http://fa.bianp.net">Fabian Pedregosa</a>.</p>
      	<h3>Can I say something ?</h3>
      	<p>Sure!. I'd love to hear some feedback. If it's an issue with the website feel free to open an issue <a href="https://github.com/fabianp/nbgallery/issues">here</a>. You can also email me at f@bianp.net</p>
