      	<h3>Why did you make this website ?</h3>
      	<p>Have you seen the amazing stuff people are making with IPython/Jupyter notebooks ? It will blow your mind! So I needed a place where I could find more of these amazing notebooks. For now it's a simple website that displays the latests and most viewed Notebooks, however in the future I would like it to have searching and categorization features.</p>
      	<h3>Who made this website ?</h3>
      	<p>For now it's just me, <a href="http://fa.bianp.net">Fabian Pedregosa</a>.</p>
      	<h3>Can I help ?</h3>
      	<p>Sure!. The code is on github, where you can also send bug reports (a.k.a issues) and patches (a.k.a. pull requests)</p>
