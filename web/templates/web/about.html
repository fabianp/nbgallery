        <h3>What is this website ?</h3>
        <p>This website is a collection of links to IPython/Jupyter notebooks. Contrary to other galleries (such as the one on <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/">nbviewer</a> and the <a href="https://wakari.io/gallery">wakari gallery</a>), this collection is continuously updated with notebooks submitted by users. Also note that this website does not contain nor host any notebooks, only offers links to relevant notebooks.</p>
      	<h3>Why did you make this website ?</h3>
      	<p>Have you seen the amazing stuff people are making with IPython/Jupyter notebooks ? It will blow your mind! So I needed a place where I could find more of these amazing notebooks. For now it's a simple website that displays the latests and most viewed Notebooks, however in the future I would like it to have searching and categorization features.</p>
      	<h3>Can I say something ?</h3>
      	<p>Sure!. I'd love to hear some feedback. If it's an issue with the website feel free to open an issue <a href="https://github.com/fabianp/nbgallery/issues">here</a>. You can also email <a href="http://fa.bianp.net">me</a> at f@bianp.net.</p>
